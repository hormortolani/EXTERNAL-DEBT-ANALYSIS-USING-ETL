# EXTERNAL-DEBT-ANALYSIS-USING-ETL

####In my ETL project focused on external debt data for countries, I used Python to web scrape data from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_external_debt). After extracting the data, I performed data manipulation using pandas to format the table, making it more suitable for basic analysis. I then transferred the cleaned data into an SQL database, where I wrote queries to address key questions, such as:

- Summing the total debt for a specific year.
- Calculating the average per capita debt.
- Listing countries or territories with debt above a certain percentage of GDP.

The dataset consisted of 211 rows and 8 columns, where I renamed some columns and dropped unnecessary ones to streamline the data. Afterward, the dataset was moved to Power BI for further analysis and visualization.

The tools I utilized were Python, SQL, and Power BI.
